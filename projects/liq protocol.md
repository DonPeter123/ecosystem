LIQ Protocol is an on-chain liquidation protocol built for Serum DEX margin markets and lending platforms on the Solana network. The protocol provides liquidity through its engines to manage liquidations fulltime for Solana based margin / borrowing projects, which allows projects to have a solidified backend for dealing with settlement liquidity.

The liquidator checks for overexposed accounts, prepares those accounts for liquidation, then provides funds to the liquidated accounts liabilities, and in return receives funds from the liquidated accountâ€™s collateral.

The liquidators profits are split between going back to the liquidators insurance fund and buying back LIQ for staking rewards.
